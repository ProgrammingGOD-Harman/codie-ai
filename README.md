# AI Coding Agent 🤖💻

*A playful AI assistant that helps you explore, edit, and debug code.*

This is a small experiment: a coding sidekick powered by an LLM.  
It’s not trying to be a full IDE or production tool — just a fun way to interact with your code using natural language.  
Think of it as a **tiny, silly cousin of Claude Code**.

## 🚀 What It Can Do (Inspired by Claude Code)

Here’s what this toy agent can do, modeled after Claude Code’s capabilities:

- 📂 **Navigate your codebase / files**  
  Ask it to explore the project structure, list directories, or find specific files.

- 📖 **Read and summarize code**  
  Open files and get explanations of their logic, purpose, or structure.

- ✍️ **Edit / overwrite files**  
  Modify or replace content in files based on your instructions (e.g. *“insert this function into `utils.py`”*).

- ▶️ **Execute Python scripts**  
  Run `.py` files with optional arguments and capture output (stdout, errors).

- 🐞 **Automatically fix bugs**
  Spot issues (syntax or logic errors) and apply fixes.

- 🔧 **Resolve simple formatting / lint issues**  
  Auto-fix style problems or minor code errors.

- 📂 **Work with context across files**  
  Understand connections between multiple files (imports, function calls) when editing.
